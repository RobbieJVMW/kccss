title: Workload has secrets as environment variables
description: >-
  Secrets such as passwords, keys, tokens, certificates, etc. should not be
  stored as environment variables. These environment variables are accessible
  inside Kubernetes by the "Get Pod" API call, and by any system, such as CI/CD,
  which has access to the definition file of the container. Secrets should be
  mounted from files.
