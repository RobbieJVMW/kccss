title: Workload is exposed through a shared host network
description: >-
  This Security Context setting allows the workload to share the same network
  namespace as the host.
shortDescription: ''
availability:
  impact: High
  description: >-
    Accidental exposure to the Internet can make the workload susceptible to DoS
    attacks from random attackers.
confidentiality:
  impact: High
  description: >-
    This allows the network to listen to the loopback interface and sniff the
    traffic to and from other pods. This setting also allows workloads to bind
    their listening IP address to the host IP, making the service accessible
    from other networks and/or from the Internet.
integrity:
  impact: Low
  description: >-
    Services open to the Internet may be used to access unprotected services
    (move laterally) by leveraging remote code vulnerabilities, vulnerable
    third-party libraries or vulnerable OS services.
