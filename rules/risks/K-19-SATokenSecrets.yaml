title: A workload mounts a Service Account Token with access to secrets
description: >-
  The Service Account Token allows the workload to query the Kubernetes API server for a specific list of resources and actions. A Service Account Token with access to secrets (get, list, watch) would allow the workload to get the secrets present in a namespace or cluster. Best practice recommends using tokens with access to secrets only when absolutely necessary to minimize exposure.
