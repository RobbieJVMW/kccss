title: Workload has a container which its CPU or Memory limit was not configured
description: >-
  CPU and Memory quotas prevent container from grabbing too many resources from
  the node, and allow a better scheduling of resources across the cluster.

  impact: High
  description: >-
    Workloads with no CPU or memory quota may starve off other workloads on the
    node, resulting in pod ejections and cascading reschedule of pods on other
    nodes.

recommendation: >-
  In your workload YAML definition, add:   containers[].resources.limits.cpu: X
  ("500m" or "1000m" for example)   Containers[].resources.limits.memory: Y
  (“512Mi” or “1Gi” for example) 

  Create a LimitRange resource in all your namespaces:   limit.default.cpu: X
  limit.default.memory: Y
